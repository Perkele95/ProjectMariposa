# MARIPOSA
*author: Arle Ã…mdal Vaara*

*I am forever grateful to C. Muratori and his project "Handmade Hero", which was both inspiring and extremely helpful.*

This is my attempt at creating my own game/game engine as a personal project.

The main goals of Mariposa is to further my own understanding of:
 - C programming
 - Windows applications
 - Game development
 - Game engine API design
 - Data-oriented design
 - 3D rendering / Vulkan API

### Goals
* Use Mariposa to create executable games for windows.
* Use Vulkan API for hardware acceleration.
* Develop Minecraft-like game.

### Unity build
Mariposa has all it's .cpp files included into one .cpp file to create a single compilation unit instead of one for each source file. This is mainly a personal choice,
as well as an experiment to see if I prefer it over the standard way (header files declare, compilation files define).

### Hot-loading
Mariposa.cpp is compiled as a DLL that can be dynamically loaded and unloaded at will. This means I can edit mariposa.cpp/.h and rebuild while running. Of course this is
only intended as a dev tool, and not for release. This feature is only for the DLL.

### Data-Oriented Design
The entire codebase is written and compiled in .cpp and .h files. Despite using C++ I use a certain subset of C++ which is
pretty much the same as C but with a couple features from C++. The reason for this is threefold:
* My own experience with OOP for game engine development in my game engine called Dyson has left me wanting to try something else. OOP made the code "simple" but way too complex and vague. Multiple inheritance, virtual functions and the general attitude that everything needs to be a class made rewriting code harder.
* C as a language has no classes. I want to follow a data-oriented / compression oriented approach to development. This means I treat problems directly rather than abstracting them into objects/concepts.
* Performance, less overhead, more understanding of what my code actually does as well as more control over memory footprint.

C++ features that come in handy:
* Function overloading. Provides some polymorphism to functions. Who needs classes anyway?
* No longer need to typedef structs and enums
* Default parameters
